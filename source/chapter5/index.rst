The Adventure Continues (ever so slowly...)
===========================================

This week, I met with Professor Craven on Wednesday, February 17th for 25
minutes to go over my progress thus far during this Project, as well as the
plan going forward. As the program that I created wasn't easily testable so I
had to go back to the drawing board and recode the entire project. Isn't
learning fun?

After some conversation, we decided it would likely be my best bet if I
basically followed Pauls tutorial located here

First Major bump in the road (or should I say Room)
---------------------------------------------------

I sat down on Thursday, the 18th of February, I very quickly realized that my
Python programming was not up to par, as so much of the code provided in the
tutorial seemed like Greek. I just wasn't remembering Python the way I should.

I then spent an hour and 15 minutes on Thursday doing some more research into
Python to jog my memory and get this program up and running so I could have
not only the program up and running, but also a few tests to go along with it.

Then, over the coming weeks, I could work on adding more tests and ensuring I
have test coverage.
